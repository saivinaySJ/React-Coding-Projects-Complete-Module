Here ima having a simple task given in React, that is : Whenever user clicks on the screen, 
we need to create a circle with random radius, you can put maximum limit, so that it does not 
go out of the screen, it should have only border and maximum two circles should be there at a 
timeand if the user clicks for the 3rd time and iftwo circles are there , thay both will be 
gone and another circle will come ad if two cricles are intersecting , you should generate 
a message in the consolestating that ' Two random circles are intersecting'.  can u do 
this in a very simple way .
